# LiFi Technology Demo

## Introduction
Welcome to my LiFi Technology Demo project! This project demonstrates data transfer using LiFi (Light Fidelity). LiFi is a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. This demo will showcase how data can be sent and received using an LED and a light sensor.

## Project Overview
This demonstration will work by placing the Raspberry Pi on a breadboard with a light sensor and an led. When the program is run the Raspberry Pi will convert text into binary and transfer it to the LED. If the LED is off it is equal to 0 and if on then 1. The sensor then reads this translating the binary back to normal text and displaying it.
