# Binary-Translator
This is a binary translator intended to be used for some Li-Fi tech for a school assignment. Enjoy!

The Binary folder will give 0/1 as an in/out-put

The LED folder will give LED_ON/LED_OFF as an in/out-put

The LED with webpage folder has 2 options (Line OR Flash). Line will make a line of on/off outputs. Flash will flash on/off outputs.
